            After working and managing in retail for what seems like forever (but in fact was more like 15 years) and being made redundant, I decided not to let things get me down or contract Xboxitus (sore bum and thumbs from too much gaming), so I decided to learn HTML(5) and CSS(3). As a byproduct I started using Linux, and all the command prompt coding that goes with it as this allowed me greater control over my OS. The end product from all of this is what is before you now. 
            <br/>
            So what is there to know about me?? How about what I am looking for, as you can see from my
            <a href="portfolio.html" target="_blank">Portfolio</a> 
            and
            <a href="showroom.html" target="_blank">Showroom</a>
            I have been busy over the last few weeks getting to grips with programming, using tools like Bootstrap and Material Design. I use two computers to code on, using Sublime Text on my portable notebook when commuting, and even when I'm at lunch (I have got a temporary position at John Lewis' new flagship store in Leeds), and WebStorm on my the zero battery-life laptop at home. Essentially I am looking for a position where I will be able to continue learning and developing these skills, whether that be in a junior role or an apprenticeship to start with.
