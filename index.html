            After working and managing in retail for what seems like forever (but in fact was more like 15 years) and
            being made redundant, I decided not to let things get me down or contract Xboxitus (sore bum and thumbs
            from too much gaming). So I decided to learn HTML(5) and CSS(3), and this is why this is here. So what is

            I have been busy over the last few weeks getting to grips with programming, using tools like Bootstrap and
            Material Design. Essentially I am looking for a position where I will be able to continue learning and
            developing these skills, whether that be in a junior role or an apprenticeship to start with.
